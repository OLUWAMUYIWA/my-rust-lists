Negative quote about Rust's liberal reputation.

"Socially, I live in a fairly conservative area (and, surprisingly,
programmers are more conservative than the average person here), and
the Rust community's reputation is a barrier to even talking about
Rust at times. The actual state of the community is much better than
it was three years ago, but the initial experiences a lot of people
had have remained, particularly as a lot of enterprise bros simply do
not participate in extracurricular activities like HN and reddit and
only get hearsay exposure."

Andrei Alexandrescu's "leg day" quote.

"Reading any amount of Rust code evokes the joke "friends don't let
friends skip leg day" and the comic imagery
(https://www.google.com/search?q=...) of men with hulky torsos resting
on skinny legs. Rust puts safe, precise memory management front and
center of everything. Unfortunately, that's seldom the problem domain,
which means a large fraction of the thinking and coding are dedicated
to essentially a clerical job (which GC languages actually automate
out of sight)."
